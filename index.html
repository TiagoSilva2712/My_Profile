            <h2>A little bit about me</h2>

            <p>Hi, I'm Tiago Silva, and I'm passionate about technology. I'm about to graduate in Computer Science and besides my native language Portuguese, I also communicate in English and French</p>

            <p> I'm married to the most beautiful woman in the world, Tamires (sorry to the rest of the women out
                there) and we live in São Paulo, Brazil.
            </p>

            <p>Together, Tamires and I serve God at the Assembly of God, Bethlehem Ministry.</p>

            <p>I'm a lover of learning! I enjoy discovering how things work in the world — and through that, I see God's
                hands in everything. In my free time, I like reading good books, spending time with friends, and playing
                video games.</p>

            <p>Check out my social media below.</p>
